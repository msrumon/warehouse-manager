# Warehouse Manager

This is a very simple warehouse manager, where ADMINs can create suppliers and MANAGERs can create products. I made this to demonstrate how you can build a [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) application with PHP using role-based authentication.

## Usage

Just clone / download this repository, navigate into the project folder and run:

```bash
php -S localhost:4444
```

Now open `http://localhost:4444` in a browser.
